Running Evolve on Linux or MacOSX
---------------------------------

First ensure you have Java 1.6+.

Then, either double-click on evolve.jar in a file manager, or execute it directly using java:

  java -jar evolve.jar

If any any doubts about the version, type:

  java -version
  
Note that the Mac seems to start with a low memory allocation.  Increase this by using something like:

	java -Xmx512m -jar evolve.jar
	
If you have any problems, feel free to send mail to info@intrinsarc.com and I will help you resolve any issues.
