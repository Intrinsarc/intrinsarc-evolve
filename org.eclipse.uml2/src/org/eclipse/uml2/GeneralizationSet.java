	 * Indicates (via the associated Generalizations) whether or not the set of specific Classifiers are covering for a particular general classifier. When isCovering is true, every instance of a particular general Classifier is also an instance of at least one of its specific Classifiers for the GeneralizationSet. When isCovering is false, there are one or more instances of the particular general Classifier that are not instances of at least one of its specific Classifiers defined for the GeneralizationSet. For example, Person could have two Generalization relationships each with a different specific Classifier: Male Person and Female Person. This GeneralizationSet would be covering because every instance of Person would be an instance of Male Person or Female Person. In contrast, Person could have a three Generalization relationships involving three specific Classifiers: North AmericanPerson, Asian Person, and European Person. This GeneralizationSet would not be covering because there are instances of Person for which these three specific Classifiers do not apply. The first example, then, could be read: any Person would be specialized as either being a Male Person or a Female Person—and nothing else; the second could be read: any Person would be specialized as being North American Person, Asian Person, European Person, or something else.
