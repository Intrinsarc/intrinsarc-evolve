/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Include</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Include is a DirectedRelationship between two use cases, implying that the behavior of the included use case is inserted into the behavior of the including use case. It is also a kind of NamedElement so that it can have a name in the context of its owning use case. The including use case may only depend on the result (value) of the included use case. This value is obtained as a result of the execution of the included use case. Note that the included use case is not optional, and is always required for the including use case to execute correctly.
