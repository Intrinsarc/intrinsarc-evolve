 * A Gate is a connection point for relating a Message outside an InteractionFragment with a Message inside the InteractionFragment. Gate is a specialization of MessageEnd. Gates are connected through Messages. A Gate is actually a representative of an EventOccurrence that is not in the same scope as the Gate. Gates play different roles: we have formal gates on Interactions, actual gates on InteractionOccurrences, expression gates on CombinedFragments.
