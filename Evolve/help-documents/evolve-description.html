<b>The Evolve modeling environment and Backbone component language</b>
<br><br>

Evolve and Backbone provide a highly principled, component-oriented approach to system construction and evolution.
Evolve allows a program to be modeled as hierarchical structures.  It can then create a Backbone program which can be executed.
The system is based on the PhD and research work of Andrew McVeigh and others.
