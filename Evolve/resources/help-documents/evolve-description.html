<b>The Evolve modeling environment and Backbone component language</b>
<br><br>

Evolve and Backbone provide a highly principled, component-oriented approach to system construction and evolution.
Evolve allows a program to be modeled as hierarchical structures using the UML2 composite structure notation.
It can then create a Backbone program which can be executed, either inside or outside of Evolve.
The system is based on the PhD and research work of Andrew McVeigh and others, and is the culmination of a
programme started in 2002 to make naturally extensible and evolvable application.
