This work is dedicated to our families for putting up with the long years of research and development work.
<br><br>
We would also like to express our deep gratitude to Professors <a href="http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/jnm">Jeff Magee</a> and <a href="http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/jk">Jeff Kramer</a> from <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a>.  Without their pioneering work on
Darwin and hierarchical components, architecture description languages, formal semantics of system flattening, dynamic architecture change and isomorphic factories this work would not be possible.
<br><br>
We would like to acknowledge the amazing work and technical vision of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ObjecTime">ObjecTime</a> and <a href="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/people/people.php?Name=Bran%20V.+Selic">Bran Selic</a>.  We mention in particular the work on statecharts, actors and inheritance of component structures.  Twenty years later the system is still ahead of its time and a continuing inspiration.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Selic:Bran.html">Bran</a> for introducing us to composite structure diagrams and the <a href="http://www.uml.org/">UML2</a>.
<br><br>
Thanks also to <a href="http://www.kobryn.com/bio.htm">Cris Kobryn</a> for answering our questions on component modeling and its relationship to the real world.
