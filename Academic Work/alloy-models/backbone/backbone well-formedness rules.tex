Composition rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Strata compose Components, Interfaces
\item Components compose Ports, Properties, Parts, Connectors
\item Parts compose PropertyBindings, (PortInstances)
\item Connectors compose ConnectorEnds 
\end{enumerate}
Well-formedness rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item No Stratum cycles are allowed
\item Ports must have visibility of their required and provided Interfaces
\item Parts must have visibility of their Component type
\item The Component-Part relation must not be cyclic
\item A Port must have at least 1 provided or required Interface
\item A Component must have at least 1 Port 
\end{enumerate}
Connection rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A ComponentConnectorEnd must reference a Port of the Component that
owns the Connector
\item A PortConnectorEnd must reference a valid Port of the Part's Component
type
\item ConnectorEnds in a single Connector must be fully symmetric (provides
+ requires) with regards to Interfaces
\item For each Part, a PortInstance must be present for each Port of the
Part's Component type
\item Each PortInstance must be fully connected with Connectors such that
the provided and required interfaces match exactly against PartConnectorEnds
\item Each (non-internal) Port must be fully connected with Connectors such
that the provided and required interfaces match exactly against ComponentConnectorEnds,
but with reverse polarity
\item Internal Ports must not have any Connectors
\item Parts must be eventually traceable back to a Port, following Connectors
\item There may only be 1 self-Connector per Port or PortInstance
\end{enumerate}
