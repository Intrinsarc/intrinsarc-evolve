Introduction
	The motivation for extensible applications
	Example Scenario
	Requirements for Approach
	Thesis Outline

Background
	Architecture Description Languages
	Component Technologies
	System Extensibility
		(includes resolution of conflicts)
		Object-oriented Language approaches (frameworks, mixins, units, nested inheritance)
		Aspects
		Parametrisation (Koala)
		Architecturally aware CM systems
		Plugin Architectures
  		Scripting
		Product Lines / Families
	Summary

Requirements for Extensibility in an Architectural Context
  (from SAVCBS 2006 paper)

The Backbone Model (merge into single chapter with next)
	(introduces the model gradually)
	Defining the desk application
	Extending the Application: Adding a CD Player
	Evolving the Application: Upgrading to add a new facility
	Combining Extensions
	Summary

The Backbone Model
	(use example to introduce model and show how it meets requirements)
	The Basic Component Model
		Explain full model using previous example
		Dynamicity
	Extension Constructs
		Resemblance
		Replacement
		Stratum
		Concept of perspective
		Baselining
	Techniques and Patterns
		Visitor, Factory, Singleton, State machines
	Formal Specification
		Coverage of specification (component + interfaces + stratum + constructs + rules + conflict handling)
		Type inference
		What's missing
		Explain how replacement and resemblance are combined with strata dependencies to give constituents
		Explain conflict detection and handling
		Explain significant properties

Tool Support for Backbone
	Requirements (manageability, support for large models, inference, sharing models)
	Mapping onto UML2
	Explain facilities of CASE tool

Comparisons to Existing Approaches
	Compare and contrast with plugin architectures
	Compare and contrast with COM
	Compare and contrast with Koala and parametrised approaches

Modeling the LTSA Product Family
	Show parts of LTSA and how Backbone could model this
	Compare and contrast with Rob's plugin approach + other ad-hoc approaches

Building on the Structural Foundation
	Describing behaviour in an extensible system using sequence charts and FSP
	Detecting behavioural conflicts

Conclusions and Future Work

Appendix A: The Backbone Structural Specification
	Approach
	Concepts
	Rules
	Properties
	Mapping onto advanced features: indices, factories, hyperports

Appendix B: Mapping Protocols onto FSP

Appendix C: Full Alloy Models

Appendix D: Implementation of DeltaEngine from specification
