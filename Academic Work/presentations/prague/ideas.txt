title:	"Adding Support for Evolution to an ADL"
		or 	"A Rigorous, Architectural Approach to Extensible Applications"
subtitle: ("or can we make software extension and evolution as natural as creation?")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro presentation (40 mins)

- introduce problem domain using example system & scenarios from phd
	
- requirements x 5 + justifications
	- not uncommon now; look at netbeans, eclipse, wordpress, firefox - all extensible

- look at options: eclipse plugin model, product lines, version control
	- full combination checking is manual and error prone
	
- explain compositional model briefly in context of radio station example
	- explain why this was picked - show how this works intra-VM
	- common with spring (they just don't know it)
	- introduce strata
	- encodes many good practices of OO: composition, interface decoupling, no cycles
	
- introduce 2 primitives: resemblance and replacement, explain evolution
	- show how these work
	
- assess against the requirements

- intro to evolve
	- show how deltas are marked, how modification works
	- how to invoke checking
	- running from inside tool
	- export / import of strata?

- future work (behaviour, goals) + commercial toolset
	- challenges - composition must be taught before compositional evolution
	- behaviour, goals, reversing dependencies
	- team version of evolve

	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced presentation: Advanced Techniques in Evolve
- show how resemblance and replacement interact
	- introduce alloy model and show graphs
- hyperports
- patterns in evolve:
	- state, visitor, singleton
- tie in to java/impl
- discuss protocols + goals

Tutorial: A Car Rental System (3 hrs)

- show this running, explain it was built with Hibernate and GWT (stress exotic)

Tutorial A:
	- Getting the system installed and running
	- Simple car rental example

Tutorial B:
	- Resemblance and replacement
	
Tutorial C:
	- Factories, hyperports and states
	
Tutorial D: Evolve in the real world
	- importing GWT/beans
	- creating user interface
	- creating server
	- switching in and out real implementations
	- generating full java code...
