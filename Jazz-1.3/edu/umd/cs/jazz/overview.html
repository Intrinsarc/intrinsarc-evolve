Welcome to Jazz! Jazz is a revolutionary way to create
robust, full-featured graphical applications in Java, with
striking features such as zooming and multiple
representation. Jazz is an extensive toolkit based on the
Java2D API. And best of all, Jazz is not only free, it's open
source!<p>

Jazz is a general-purpose Java-based engine that supports 2D visualizations. 
A primary characteristic of Jazz is that it is designed to support zoomable 
information spaces, although any particular applications may or may not
take advantage of this feature. Jazz is implemented entirely in Java 2, and 
as such runs identically on any platform that supports Java 2. <p>

Jazz is not an application in itself, but rather it is an engine that is designed to 
support applications that require the ability to create, manipulate, and render 
object-oriented graphics. If you are familiar with the terminology of 3D graphics, 
Jazz supports a scenegraph. This is a data structure that represents a hierarchy 
of graphical objects. Jazz uses the Java2D rendering engine, and uses a tuned 
run-time system to render the scenegraph as
quickly as possible to support interactive applications. <p>
