# Directions for building the internal parser (ZInternalParser) using JavaCC
#
#

1. Download and install JavaCC.
	- JavaCC can be found at http://www.metamata.com/JavaCC/
	- The file you downloaded is a self-running/installing java program.
	  run the program using java:
	  java JavaCC2_0
	- Install the software where you like (i.e.: c:\download) recommended
	- Modify the PATH environment variable to include the bin directory of the
	  JavaCC install (c:\java\JavaCC\bin in this example).
	- Execute javacc.bat to make sure the software is installed.  You should see about
	  a page and a half of output scroll by.  Note
	  Note that on windows, you must execute javacc.bat, and not just javacc
	  or you may see some strange error messages, and it won't work.

2. Remove/Delete the JavaCC generated files.  DO NOT remove all .java files, remove 
   only the generated files.  The following files are generated by JavaCC :
	- ASCII_UCodeESC_CharStream.java
	- ParseException.java
	- Token.java
	- TokenMgrError.java
	- ZInternalParser.java
	- ZInternalParserConstants.java
	- ZInternalParserTokenManager.java

3. Use JavaCC to generate the internal parser and all associated files :
	javacc.bat ZInternalParser.jj

4. Build the package normally :
	build all
