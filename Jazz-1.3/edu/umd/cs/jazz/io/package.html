This package supports the Jazz file format.  It contains classes for dumping a Jazz
scenegraph (or any subtree) to an output stream.  It is similar in functionality to
Java Serialization, but the file format is more version resistant, and is entirely
text-based.
<p>
Note that this file format will likely be replaced in the future with an XML
based format.
