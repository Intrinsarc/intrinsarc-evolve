Jazz is a general-purpose Java-based engine that supports 2D visualizations.
A primary characteristic of Jazz is that it is designed to support
zoomable information spaces, although any particular applications may or
may not take advantage of this feature. Jazz is implemented entirely in Java
2, and as such runs identically on any platform that supports Java 2. 
<P>
Jazz is not an application in itself, but rather it is an engine that is designed to
support applications that require the ability to create, manipulate, and
render object-oriented graphics. If you are familiar with the terminology of 3D
graphics, Jazz supports a scenegraph. This is a data structure that
represents a hierarchy of graphical objects. Jazz uses the Java2D rendering
engine, and uses a tuned run-time system to render the scenegraph as
quickly as possible to support interactive applications. 
<P>
This is the root package for all Jazz classes. It contains the core scenegraph
classes itself,
and in addition,  contains the <code>io</code>, <code>event</code>, 
<code>component</code> and <code>util</code> packages
that are used to build Jazz applications.
